<h1>WHY AMAZING WORLD OF GUMBALL IS GOOD</h1>
<p>this cartoon is very relatable, funny, and has a great ending. each episode has its own storyline that gives you a lot of suspense, and hilarious jokes.</p>

</p>1. the main character isn't plain, not only that but he's even my favorite character..which is rare for a mc.<p>
</p>2. everyone in the show has a great story, and an episode about them so they aren't just "side characters".<p>
</p>3. gumball's parents also are a big part of the entire show. which usually is the opposite, where the main characters parents are um..absent<p>
</p>4. any age can watch the show. im 14, and i still find every episode hilarious.<p>
</p>5. the ending is amazing, and the fact the VILLIAN only knows about the true secret of their world is just so cool.<p>
